# 🧩 LOGICXGNN: GROUNDED LOGICAL RULES FOR EXPLAINING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

This is the official repository of **LogicXGNN**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Multiple GNN backbones:
  - **GCN**, **GIN**, **GAT**, **GraphSAGE**, and etc.
- Wide range of datasets:
  - **Molecule datasets**: BBBP, Mutagenicity, NCI1  
  - **Synthetic**: BAMultiShapes  
  - **Social**: IMDB-BINARY, Reddit, Twitch, GitHub stargazers
- Explanation modules:
  - Derive **predicates** from GNN embeddings and the underlying message-passing topology.
  - Extract **logical rules** over these predicates to approximate and interpret GNN decisions.
  - Efficiently **ground predicates** into representative subgraphs, supported by general grounding rules.

- Training utilities:
  - Class-balanced weights
  - Checkpoint saving/loading
  - Early stopping thresholds per dataset

## 🛠 Usage

### Training a Model

```bash
python main.py --dataset BBBP --arch GCN --seed 42
```

### Arguments

- `--dataset`: one of `BBBP`, `Mutagenicity`, `IMDB-BINARY`, `NCI1`, `BAMultiShapes`, `reddit_threads`, `twitch_egos`, `github_stargazers`
- `--arch`: one of `GCN`, `GIN`, `GAT`, `GraphSAGE`
- `--seed`: random seed (default: 0)
- `--load`: load a pretrained model
- `--max_depth`: maximum depth for decision tree explanations
- `--plot`: whether to plot predicates (default: 0)

### Example

Train a GIN on Mutagenicity:

```bash
python main.py --dataset Mutagenicity --arch GIN --seed 1
```

## 📊 Explanation Pipeline

1. Train or load a GNN model.
2. Extract graph/node activations from intermediate layers.
3. Train a Decision Tree surrogate model on graph embeddings.
4. Extract rules and predicates based on the surrogate.
5. Visualize subgraphs with orbit annotations and explanations.

---

## ✅ Outputs

The framework reports:

- Training and test accuracy of GNNs
- Surrogate decision tree fidelity vs. GNN predictions
- Weighted/unweighted precision, recall, and F1-scores
- Extracted rules and predicates with visualization of subgraphs
